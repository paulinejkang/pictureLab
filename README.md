**Lab Instructions**

Review the [lab instructions](https://github.com/Branham-Computer-Science-23-24/PictureLab/blob/master/PictureLabStudentGuide.pdf) in the project files.

**Setup Instructions**

1. For best results, ensure that _Use credential helper_ is enabled. It can be found under _File_ → _Settings_ → _Version Control_ at the bottom of the page.
2. Fork the existing repo. Tutorial [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).
3. Clone the repo into IntelliJ. Tutorial [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/java/tips/clone-project-from-github/).
4. If the PictureExplorer.java main method doesn't find a picture, you will need to change line 111 of FileChooser.java to be the correct file path. You will need to change the string to be the absolute file path. More details can be found under Set-up on page 3 of the [lab instructions](https://github.com/Branham-Computer-Science-23-24/PictureLab/blob/master/PictureLabStudentGuide.pdf).

**Tips for Working on the Lab**
+ Follow the steps in the lab. Check the due dates in Canvas to ensure you are completing the correct activities at the correct time.
+ Commit the changes and push it to the GitHub after every activity, finished working on a computer, and large modification of the original code.
+ Whenever you start working on a different computer from last time, clone the repo if it isn't there already or pull to update the code on the current computer.

**Maintaining the Repository**

The three main parts of syncing your GitHub repository (repo) with IntelliJ on your computer are: commit, push, and pull. When you are finished working on your project on a computer, commit and push your changes to GitHub. To start working on the project on a different computer, pull the repo from GitHub into IntelliJ.

+ __Commit__: A commit captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. To make a commit, click the _Commit_ menu on the left toolbar (or Alt+0) and select/toggle the __.java__ files that you have updated. Write a brief description of what has been updated. You can click _Commit_ if you want to save your changes locally or _Commit and Push_ to save your changes to the GitHub repo.
+ __Push__: Saves your committed changes to your GitHub repo. To push, click the _Git_ → _Push_ from the top toolbar or _Commit and Push_ from the _Commit_ menu on the left toolbar (or Alt+0).
+ __Pull__: Retrieves the current state of the repo on GitHub. To pull, click the _Git_ → _Pull_ from the top toolbar.
